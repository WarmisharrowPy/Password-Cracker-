I prefer to use Pycharm IDE

Installation

For windows users

(run those in command prompt/cmt/terminal) For random options `pip install random`

For linux users

Learn all the above commands on terminal. Make sure to use `pip3`, because in linux `pip` refers for python2 and `pip3` refers to python3. Install these too - `pip3 install random` and `pip3 install random`
